                                            can be attained only with the help of experienced and skilled teachers. This is where the role of PNS IAS Coaching Institute comes into play. Institutes not only provide aspirants with study material and classes

                                            Success. Among these factors are self-study, time management etc. Self study always trumps any kind of teaching method, the time a person invests on something when he/she is not being supervised is the most
                                            important. With self study, the aspirant becomes aware about his/her weaknesses and can then work on them to improve. Self study also helps the aspirant to manage their time in a very efficient manner.</p>
